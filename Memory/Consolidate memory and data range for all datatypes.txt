
Consolidate memory and data range for all datatypes

* Boolean data type - 1 bit (true/false)
* Byte data type - 2 byte (Its value-range lies between -128 to 127 )
* Char data type - 1 byte (Its value-range lies between 0 to 65,535)
* Short data type - 2 byte (Its value-range lies between -32,768 to 32,767.)
* Int data type - 4 byte (Its value-range lies between -32,768 to 32,767) 
* Long data type - 8 byte (64-bit) (Its value-range lies between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63) to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807(2^63 -1))
* Float data type - 4 byte (Its value range is unlimited. It is recommended to use a float (instead of double) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers.)
* double data type - 8 byte( It provides higher precision than float and is commonly used for calculations involving decimal numbers.)
* Strings - The String class represents a sequence of characters. 
* Arrays - Arrays are used to store a collection of elements of the same type. 
* Classes - The class data type represents a class in Java.
